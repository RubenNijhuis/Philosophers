# Philosophers
üßê  Philosophers is a project for Codam (42 network) which teaches multithreading and the usage of mutexes

# Quick start

$ make run
```
And watch as the philosophers dine and enjoy a nice meal

## Running the program

$ ./bin/philsophers [amount_philo] [time_to_die (ms)] [time_to_eat (ms)] [time_to_sleep  (ms)] [optional amount_times_eat]
```
